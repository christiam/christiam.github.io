You may run BLAST searches using an API like the [NCBI BLAST URL
API](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Doc/urlapi.html). Every call to the URL
API must include the `CMD` parameter, which can take one of four different
arguments.  You may use `Put` for search submission, `Get` for checking the
status of a submission or retrieving results, `Delete` to remove a search and
its results or `DisplayRIDs` to list all RIDs in the system.  Each argument to
`CMD` requires or allows certain other parameters as described in the table
below.
To run a search, you should:

1. Launch a BLAST AMI. The security group must allow access through HTTP. If
possible, restrict the allowed IP's for HTTP so as to include only those of the
intended users. See [their Getting Started
Guide](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/GettingStartedGuide/)
for details.

1. Once the instance has launched, obtain the Public DNS from the EC2
Management Console. The Public DNS will look something like:
`ec2-54-82-43-97.compute-1.amazonaws.com` though the exact numbers and letters
will be depend upon your instance.

1. Launch a search using your Public DNS plus cgi-bin/blast.cgi. For the
example Public DNS given above, a URL to search the sequence of accession
u00001 against nt would be:
`ec2-54-82-43-97.compute-1.amazonaws.com/cgi-bin/blast.cgi?QUERY=u00001&DATABASE=nt&PROGRAM=blastn&CMD=Put`

1. The instance will return a "Request ID" (`RID`). You may check the status of
the search by invoking blast.cgi with the parameters `CMD=Get`,
`FORMAT_OBJECT=SearchInfo`, and `RID=VALUE`, where `VALUE` is the `RID` returned by
the server.  The server will respond with a page containing a `QBlastInfo`
block with the status set as one of `WAITING`, `UNKNOWN`, or `READY`.

1. Once the search is finished, you may retrieve results by invoking blast.cgi
with the parameters `CMD=GET` and `RID=VALUE`, where `VALUE` is the `RID` the system
returned. An example would be "CMD=Get&RID=6NTRF1YLO8". You may also specify
the report type, but need to include `FORMAT_OBJECT=Alignment` (e.g, add
`FORMAT_OBJECT=Alignment&FORMAT_TYPE=Tabular`).


The BLAST instance at AWS supports a **_subset_** of the NCBI-BLAST URL parameters. The table below lists the supported parameters. An asterisk (*) in the CMD column indicates that the parameter is required for that command.


|Parameter              | Definition              | Type | CMD | Allowed values                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|------|-----|--------------------------------|
|`QUERY`|Search query|String|Put *|Accession, GI, or FASTA.|
|`DATABASE`|BLAST database|String|Put *|Database from appendix 2 or one uploaded to blastdb_custom (see appendix 4)|
|`PROGRAM`|BLAST program|String|Put *|One of blastn, megablast, blastp, blastx, tblastn, tblastx|
|`FILTER`|Low complexity filtering|String|Put |F to disable. T or L to enable. Prepend "m" for mask at lookup (e.g., mL)|
|`FORMAT_TYPE`|Report type|String|Put, Get| HTML, Text, XML, XML2, JSON2, or Tabular. HTML is the default.|
|`EXPECT`|Expect value|Double|Put|Number greater than zero.|
|`NUCL_REWARD`|Reward for matching bases (BLASTN and megaBLAST)|Integer|Put|Integer greater than zero.|
|`NUCL_PENALTY`|Cost for mismatched bases (BLASTN and megaBLAST)|Integer|Put|Integer less than zero.|
|`GAPCOSTS`|Gap existence and extension costs|String|Put|Pair of positive integers separated by a space such as "11 1".|
|`HITLIST_SIZE`|Number of databases sequences to keep| Integer|Put,Get| Integer greater than zero.|
|`DESCRIPTIONS`|Number of descriptions to print (applies to HTML and Text)| Integer|Put,Get| Integer greater than zero.|
|`ALIGNMENTS`|Number of alignments to print (applies to HTML and Text)| Integer|Put,Get| Integer greater than zero.|
|`NCBI_GI`|Show NCBI GIs in report|String|Put, Get|T or F|
|`RID`|BLAST search request identifier|String|Get *, Delete *|The Request ID (RID) returned when the search was submitted|
|`THRESHOLD`|Neighboring score for initial words|Integer | Put | Positive integer (BLASTP default is 11). Does not apply to BLASTN or MegaBLAST).|
|`WORD_SIZE`|Size of word for initial matches| Integer| Put | Positive integer.|
|`COMPOSITION_BASED_STATISTICS`| Composition based statistics algorithm to use| Integer | Put| One of 0, 1, 2, or 3. See `comp_based_stats` command line option in the [BLAST+ user manual](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279675/) for details.|
|`FORMAT_OBJECT`|Object type| String | Get | SearchInfo (status check) or Alignment (report formatting).|
|`NUM_THREADS`| Number of virtual CPUs to use| Integer | Put | Integer greater than zero (default is 1).|


If a parameter is not required and not provided, then the default value will be
used. That default value may depend upon the BLAST search you are running.

If you have not restricted your security group, please also note that anybody
with knowledge of your public DNS can use `CMD=DisplayRIDs` to see all remote
searches available on the system.
