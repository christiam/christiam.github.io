title: "The FUSE client"
order: 2

The FUSE client can download the BLAST databases listed in the table below. The
client is configured to download the most recent version of these BLAST
databases at the time of the first search, but these BLAST databases will not
be automatically updated as newer databases become available. To force the
client to switch to the newest database (and discard the last one downloaded),
it is necessary to issue the following commands:

    /sbin/remote-fuser-ctl.pl --stop
    /sbin/remote-fuser-ctl.pl --start

The FUSE client downloads the BLAST database over the network, so the first
BLAST search against a new database will be slow. The client caches the
database on disk and subsequent searches will be faster.
Or, terminate the existing instance and start a new one. The new instance will cache the latest data.
